The script has function seg.clus.p (line 408-715) which will be the
one to look at


Essentially for p-value it takes cumulative probability distribution
for a given log ratio, using the mean log ratio of a given segment
and the correcting for multiple hypothesis testing


============================

This is very encouraging. Couple of points:

1. From the analysis of pooled normal, I think the issues is w.r.t to
IMPACT bait version for pooled normal not being the same as tumor wherever
there are those Amplification seen.

2. As its done in DMP can we figure out a way to find best normal to use
that has the least noise. As you can observe in certain Match cases you
see the same waterfall effect.

3. We also need to do run this on Normals to see if we see a quiet
profile. Probably we can start with Normal with Pooled Normal

4. There are couple of stats that we can calculate:

    A. Genes that are Gain, Amplified, Deleted. (we can decide how to assign
p-value later) I can compare them to original IMPACT calls.

    B. Some kind of qc based on
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-016-3074-7) or
(https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt479#32650675).

    C. Not to forget we also need to calculate Intragenic
deletion/amplification based on clustering of exons.

Also It would be great if we have a README of what exactly are we doing.

Let me know what part I can help.

Venkat, this is the same Pancreatic Neuroendocrine data that I had shown
you having lot of LOH across different Tumors.

Best,
